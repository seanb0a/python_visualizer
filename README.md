# python_visualizer
A simple audio visualizer in python with pygame, pyaudio, audioop &amp; wave.
Don't use it if you are sensitive to flashing lights.

How do I use this?
Easy: turn down your volume,
python main.py <sound_file_directory.wav>

Yes, it only accepts wave files.

This is one of my first small projects, I thought it looked cool, but it probably won't in 2 years time.
